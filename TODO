memory management

       - count allocs and free
       - warn at program exit (man atexit) if unbalanced
       - let alloc and free keep track of allocated size and dirty
         buffer upon free (offensive programming), configurable at
         compile time

smart build system (see baselib)

	- detect byte ordering (little-endian, big-endian)
	- ensure sizeof(long int) IS sizeof(void *)
	- ensure sizeof(byte) IS 1, sizeof(short) IS 2 and sizeof(int) IS 4,
	  FAIL if no (exhaust possibilities, C code has to adapt to
	  architecture)
