smarter build system (see baselib)

	- detect byte ordering (little-endian, big-endian)
	- ensure sizeof(long int) IS sizeof(void *)
	- ensure sizeof(byte) IS 1, sizeof(short) IS 2 and sizeof(int) IS 4,
	  FAIL if no (exhaust possibilities, C code has to adapt to
	  architecture)

list

	list alloc with tail (incref on all lists)
	list free with tail (decref on all lists)
	list traverse with tail example
	list reverse
	list duplicate
	list flatten
