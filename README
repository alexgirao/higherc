high level structures for c programming

     objective: software development library for common, 32-bit architectures or higher

data structures

     - single linked lists (list)

design/usability notes

     - use of unsigned integers are avoided, unless when dealing with
       bit wise data, on modern architectures, with two's complement
       representation, no cycle cost is added to basic arithmetic and
       flow control (add, sub, jump)

     - implicity conversion between signed and unsigned types is
       avoided at all cost

api instructions

    - unless explicitly stated, all structure members are read-only
    - fixed-size structures returns a boolean on allocation
